- 👋 Hi, I’m Ben!
- 👀 I’m interested in Front End Web Development and currently study Computer Science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript & PHP.
- 🌐 I recently created a browser addon, Focus Search.
- 🚀 By the end of the year I hope to have developed:
    - My own e-commerce website through the development project for my degree.  
    ✅ A protfolio website as part of my Front End Web Development module.  
    ✅ A minimalistic web browser extension which automatically locates and 'focuses' the primary search input of a website.
