- 👋 Hi, I’m Ben!
- 👀 Computer Science gratuate interested in Front End Web Dev and automating infrastructure deployment and management.
- 🌐 I recently created a browser addon, [Focus Search](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/search-bar-focus/obpjnhenhageebpgaaidbokphnniilji).
- 🚀 By the end of the year I hope to have developed:
   - ✅ My own e-commerce website through the development project for my degree.  
   - ✅ A portfolio website as part of my Front End Web Development module.  
   - ✅ A minimalistic web browser extension that automatically locates and 'focuses' the primary search input of a website.
- 💻 Currently learning Powershell and Ansible to help automate things in my day job.
